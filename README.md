# My Experience

Building this portfolio website was a great learning experience. I improved my understanding of HTML structure and learned how to use Tailwind CSS to design responsive and visually appealing layouts without writing custom CSS. It also helped me understand better UI/UX practices and how to organize content effectively for a personal brand. This project gave me more confidence in front-end development and made me excited to keep learning and building more.
